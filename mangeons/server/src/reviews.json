This is a great place to visit on a date night or with a small group of friends. Everything is served family style- similar to tapas restaurants. The food is stellar. We started with hot chai (free refills) and a few mango lassis. The lassi was thick, creamy, and authentic- it reminded me of travels to Dubai. I was a little surprised by the new menu but it did not disappoint. For our meal, we got the green tomato pakora, the daal special, chili chicken, butter chicken, and spdp. My favorites were: SPDP- It's a light wafer/crisp filled with cool creamy potato filling but it tasted like a fried deviled egg! So good and such a fun thing to eat. Tomatoes- Indian fried green tomato dish served with sweet yogurt and cilantro. BEST FRIED GREEN TOMATOES IVE EVER HAD. They're sliced thin so the batter really sticks well. when you bite it, you don't have to worry about all the breading falling off and the toppings set it over the top. Butter chicken- warm, comforting, standard Indian food done very very well. Seriously one of the best meals I've had all year.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "Chai Pani has been on my list to try.Wasn't quite sure what to order as it was a last minute decision and I was close to the area. \u00a0Rainy night 2/12/2021. Called in the order and it was fairly easy. \u00a0 Got there the door area is blocked off for limited guest entrance (Covid).Thank goodness they had a tent to cover while you wait. \u00a0 \u00a0I ordered the Vegetable Korma. \u00a0I was a bit disappointed in the portion size. \u00a0It comes with rice, raita and desi slaw (red cabbage shredded). \u00a0It was an ok flavor, \u00a0nothing I must have again. I was not impressed with the desi slaw. \u00a0It didn't taste fresh = trash. \u00a0Raita was a little liquified than accustomed, but edible. \u00a0 I will probably return to try the sliders and a couple other items. \u00a0 \u00a0Let's hope the next experience is better.", "stars": 3.0}, {"review": "My wife and I had a blast at this great little spot in Decatur. \u00a0I recommend getting there early and sharing a drink and some pani puri at the bar in the back. \u00a0Service was fantastic, and they made great recommendations. \u00a0My wife and I shared the mutton and the khamouri chicken with some basmati rice. \u00a0I would especially recommend that mutton. \u00a0This was a super fun and delicious spot. \u00a0Be sure to check it out!", "stars": 4.0}, {"review": "Was craving for some panni-puri, look no further than Chai-Pani.

You have to take it all in 1 bite for all the flavor and texture. My favorite main dish was the chili chicken. It's essentially sweet and sour chicken with more of a kick. The mutton basically melted in in my mouth. The prawn was delicious, big fan of the curry it came in. If you're a fan of shrimp I'd say take a shot. I was not much of a fan of the uttapam. For side dishes, I recommend the fried tomatoes. They're thin and crispy which is just the right amount of tomato for me.As for dessert, the gulab is basically moist donut holes. VERY sweet, and savory. The bhapa was my favorite though. It's a thicc, sweet, custard. Definitely recommend if you like custards/creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. All and all, we were very pleased by the new menu. Enjoy!", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "Loved it. Enjoyed the atmosphere. We had the butter chicken, the Dahl of the day and the chili chicken.

Mmmm So Good!!", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "Excellent food, stellar service, and a great pick-up experience for COVID. My go-to is the sloppy jai, which is, as you may guess, an elevated sloppy joe. The lamb is seasoned well, the bread is absolutely fabulous, and the yogurt sauce...well I'd probably just drink it if I could. It's packaged very well for takeout, as the meat comes in a container so it doesn't get the bread soggy. Friends have reported that everything on the menu is also great; you probably can't go wrong anywhere.COVID pick-up is very easy--they have markers outside the door spaced 6 feet apart, and when you get to the door, they hand you your band under a plastic shield. It's never taken more than a minute or two, and the employees have been exceedingly friendly every time.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "I'm a loyal Chai Pani customer and have been coming to this establishment for 4 years. They reopened dining in and was excited to try it again after getting take out for so long! Much to my dismay their menu has complete changed where they got rid of a lot of staples such as chicken Pakoras, okra fries, sloppy Jai and chicken kathi roll. Worst of all I was charged $4.00 for basmati rice. Please bring the old menu back and reasonably priced dishes", "stars": 2.0}, {"review": "Stopped in for impromptu takeout this evening--had been here before but not since pandemic. The manager and host were kind to give suggestions and explained some of the dishes-- I inquired about possible dishes which may be lower in salt content due to salt restriction for spouse- Taylor gave me some dishes and also said he could let the chef know.I have eaten many Indian dishes so not a novice. The dishes were fresh, spices in perfect combination. I ordered the corn behl-- all the ingredients tasted fresh- corn, onions and cilantro- with a light mint-lime dressing on the side. The vegetable pav- also had a nice outer (not greasy) fried texture. potato mixture was delicious. A standard dish I try often is Bhindi masala-- the okra was not mushy bit with some texture and just the right combination of aromatic spices. I have had it elsewhere where the okra has been cooked to point where there is little texture and 'swimming' in oil-- this was not the case. Oh, and the Lassi has a nice hint of cardamom. A real bonus for me to observe was that they had \u00a0COVID-19 prevention strategies that were impeccable, and safe for dining at the eatery: everyone required to wear masks (all staff actually properly wore their masks, too); ventilation was optimal with large ceiling fans; nice spacious outdoor seating. They had a hand sanitizer station upon entering into the restaurant. I will be back for sure and I applaud the staff for their great service, excellent food, and attention to detail!", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "I got this to go on Uber eats, it tasted absolutely amazing!

Highly recommend this place :)", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "Man, I wish I'd tried this place more than a month before I'm slated to move to Texas. I used to have a more narrow palette so even though I loved (and still love) Botiwala, this menu intimidated me a bit.A week ago, though, my friend and I ordered food from here, and the corn bhel and and bhel puri were great. The star, though, was the samosa cholle chaat. It was all vegan (though you need to order the Chaat without yogurt sauce). It was so good that I ordered more last night for carry out, and I practically licked the container clean.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "One of the best places in decatur by far,Chai Pani is the place to go to experience great Indian Street Food. Whether you are new to indian cuisine or you are indian and can cook it pretty well at home, I recommend everyone to try this place out! First thing thats always an important pro to me in the atlanta area is that they have free self-parking! it is limited but you can find street parking easily too! The vibe in the restaurant is homey but hip at the same time! i love all the old bollywood film art. and that the food is served in steel plates it reminds me of eating food at home with my family. For drinks they have an ample amount of nonalcoholic and alcoholic drinks! My friend and I got the sangria and i think its my new favorite sangria! i loved the hints of cinnamon! Everything is on the food menu is so so yummy! I am in love with the kale pakoras think cripsy savory appetizer that makes a girl who hates kale love kale ( aka me) I also go the chicken kathi roll and it melted in my mouth! My friend got the samosa chaat and loved it as well! And the best part is its so reasonably priced! Last thing but our server was the absolute sweetest and so helpful for helping us decide what to get! I really recommend everyone to come try this place if youre craving indian or interested in trying something new!", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "Excellent service during covid!

However I was disappointed with the flavor of the Dahi puri.Only the presentation was nice but food lacked flavor and authenticity was not there. The dahi puri was sour chutney, lacking that hint of sweetness. It needed more potatoes and lacked chickpeas. The bhel puri was a little better but it lacked chutneys. The crunch factor was there but dry.Kale pakoras were better. They were very crispy.Chicken kathi rolls (wrapped in parantha) with chutney were good but the chicken was not seasoned well. Nimbu pani disappointed me the most because that is the easiest thing to make. It lacked authenticity and freshness. There was a strong artificial taste coming from the syrup.We also tried the vegetarian thali and I can make better daal and vegetables.I really wanted to love this place but this is not the type offood I grew up eating in India and Pakistan.", "stars": 3.0}, {"review": "I've always really enjoyed the food here- spicy, tasty, crunchy, tons of variety- PLUSCOVID update: super smooth takeout experience. Ordered & paid online, and they had everything ready at our pickup time slot.

Really thoughtful, and a great eating experience.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "I should have ordered the corn behl. Where are the chick peas? The behl puri description on Chai Pani's menu via Postmates included chick peas. Used as a salad enhancer instead of a meal since it was basically fried seasonings with chutney and cabbage. We started ordering Indian food from Curry Up Now but chose take out from CP out of nostalgia.

The food is flavorful and well seasoned. I've had most everything there and they're all winners. My favorites are the paneer kati roll and the fish sliders. \u00a0Both have beautiful flavor blends.

I'm a sucker for Indian food, so I'm constantly on a hunt for good chaat and other Indian fusion food.I can safely say that my hunt is over because Chai Pani is hands-down the BEST chaat I have had in America. Even my Indian-born-and-raised mom approved...and thoroughly enjoyed the food!Firstly, the ambiance and restaurant decor lent a highly authentic vibe to the establishment, which looks like a refurbished garage. The bright colors and modern Bollywood music are sure to brighten anyone's mood! The staff are efficient, friendly, and were happy to help.Now, on to the food! We decided to order matchstick okra fries and bhel puri to share. The okra fries came with lemon and are a much healthier alternative to regular fries with an added crunch! More lemon and perhaps some salt would have been a good addition in hindsight. The bhel puri was truly amazing- it was the perfect blend of spices, chutneys, and onions. And everything was so fresh and not soggy! The portions are large and great for sharing.I ordered the mango lassi, and I'm glad I did. It was the perfect drink to wash down all the scrumptious food. This lassi was unique because it had a fair amount of cardamom, which I had not had before!For the entree, I ordered the chatpata paneer sandwich and was surprised at how simple yet delicious the dish was- the Maggi sauce was an interesting inclusion! Lastly, we ordered falooda because these are so hard to come by! It was spot-on, and my mom could not get enough!With all the food that we ordered, we had so much leftover: definitely not only got the bang for the buck, but also left feeling fulfilled and not stuffed.

I was thrown off initially as the dishes aren't what I've been conditioned to expect from an Indian restaurant and was presented with more of a small plates experience. As such I ended up ordering multiple pakoras... all of the pakoras, it felt like. Also all of the drinks. Turmeric Toddy was genius. Mango Lassi was perfect. Then there was bourbon and lots of water. Desserts, more food, great branding (tigers!) and more. Wish I'd taken more pictures because the several I have don't really do this place justice. If I lived in the area, I'd surely be a regular. And next time I'm in Atlanta, I will definitely return.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "This place is a must whenever you are in the Atlanta area. This is in Decatur which is such a cute neighborhood just 15 minutes outside of the city. There are at least a dozen good restaurants in Decatur and a phenomenal music venue called Eddie's Attic. I have been a fan of Chai Pani since it opened years ago and was completely shocked when I realized I had never written a review of this place. It is no question a five-star place! The atmosphere they have created with the decor and music takes you to a different world. There is a Pani Puri stand right there as you walk in so you can have a little taste of what is to come if you can't be seated immediately you don't have to be tortured with all the delicious smells coming from the kitchen. I have eaten so many things here that it will be hard to decide what to review, but I will go with the delectable items I have devoured many times. The dinner Thali with extra roti. It is a massive serving of basmati rice, daal, Saji, raita, hand-made roti, kachumber, Lijjat papadum, and Jamun. No, when I tried this dish for the first time I had no idea what most of this was, but it was recommended so we went for it. \u00a0I think of it as a bunch of dips and things that can be combined with rice or dip into with one of the \"bread.\" The samosa chaat is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. They are puffed flour round crisps that are stuffed with potatoes, onions, cilantro and crunchy chickpea noodles with yogurt and tamarind and green chutney. The Chatpatta Paneer sandwich is something you have to try even if you are not a vegetarian. It is a cheese sandwich with cucumber, onions, chaat masala served between two griddled buns. These are my three favorite things on the menu and I have a hard time eating anything else which is why I like to come with large groups so I can try more things.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "My sister took me here during my visit to Atlanta and it was definitely one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to! The dishes are more like tapas size so I would recommend getting a few things to share. We ended up ordering Chicken Kathi Roll, Fried Okra, and the Samosa Chaat. I thought the chicken kathi roll and the samosa chaat were both super unique and delicious because of the flavors. With the samosa, ours were still really crispy so the samosa chaat was not only flavorful but also had a lot of texture which I really enjoy.The only dish that I wouldn't order again would be the fried okra because I think it was over-fried. It was hard to taste the okra because they were fried to the point where they were more like chips and very thin and hollow, so it feels like I would eat a lot of it but still not be eating much. It was also fried too much or burnt so I tasted a lot of the bitterness.Other than that I had a great dining experience here and would definitely recommend this place.

Right next to the entrance, they have a Pani Puri stand. To be fair, it's $4 for 5 puris which is a little pricy in my opinion and they're also way too watery for me. I prefer the Dahi Puri from their chaat section instead. As for food from the menu, we ordered the Chicken Thali, Sloppy Jai, and Kale Pakora. I was impressed!

Best I've had in town so far! And trust me, the search for a well made lassi is real. Theirs is the perfect thickness! Also, it's infused with rose water mmmm. Their iced chai also exceeds my expectations; this will be the most legit chai you ever sipped on on a hot summer day. My sis and I shared the bhel puri, corn bhel, and chicken pakora which was plenty enough to share. We even had leftovers. The bhel puri is a crunchy classic that carries an explosion of flavors in your mouth. It's LOUD. Not something I'd eat by myself though cause of how intense the spices are when built up in your mouth. Although it certainly compliments great when you eat it with another milder spiced starter such as the sweet crispy corn puri. Corn bhel was my fav, it's a refreshing mixture of cilantro, corn flakes, fresh roasted corn chunks, and tomatoes. The chicken pakoras were the perfect end as it filled us up. It's lightly battered, juicy, and the sauce is addictive!!  I'm obsessed with chai pani and want to try every thing else on the menu!

There is also a nice bar if you're looking for drinks with your food. We shared the thali and some apps and were super full after. One of our appetizers was vegan and super delicious. The okra fries are the bomb here and just as tasty as the ones in Asheville. FYI there is no naan here - we eat these with our thali.

After a minimal line (Friday during lunch hours) that moved quickly; we were enjoying a vibrant, polychromatic scene and the syncopated melodies of Indian musicians. The menu is somewhat of a contemporary fusion of Indian classics i.e. this is NOT your traditional Indian cuisine, which was unexpected but delightful. It's essentially all vegetarian except for ~two dishes (which is not uncommon for Indian fare) and we couldn't order them quickly enough. :) If you've been reluctant to try Indian food because of its 'hot as an Indian summer' (which is hot AF) reputation, or you're introducing someone to Indian food for the first time, this is a great place to start. You're experiencing traditional Indian flavors but without saying \"whew\" every five minutes as you wipe the tears from your eyes and snot from your nose, also known as the 'vindaloo experience'. I had the Sloppy Jai, which was absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared. \u00a0It's not hyperbole when they say it's \"the most awesome Sloppy Joe ever\", but I'll admit the competition was meager in this field. ~~~Not a fan of sloppy joes~~~ Service was adequate, atmosphere was lovely, food was delicious and price was nominal. \u00a0Strongly recommend if you're feeling a bit adventurous but not like, 'backpacking through India' adventurous.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "This is definitely the most written about Indian restaurant in Atlanta.

One of the my favorite dishes on the menu and highly recommended.3. Mango lassi - this is mango pulp and yoghurt \u00a0based drink which is flavored with cardamom. It was one of the best mango lassi I have had in USA. It was not too thick and artificially flavored.4. Chicken and paneer kathi roll - chicken and paneer rolled in a paratha (fried , flaky, tortilla). The chicken and paneer was soft, well seasoned and had a perfect blend of spices.

They have some specials for lunch which is nice.We ordered the mango lassis for drinks, which are really good! It's like a smoothie. We also got the samosa chaat as an apetizer (my favorite). It's 2 huge pieces and it comes with a chickpea curry. It's a good dish to share because it's pretty big. We also ordered the butter chicken thali, which comes with 2 sides, rice and roti bread. The butter chicken was sooo gooood!! And the amounts are pretty big. The other entree we got was the chicken kathi roll which was great too. I wish it had come with a small side (for example the fried okra). Another dish i like is the sloppy jai (lamb burgers) they are really good!Overall the food was excellent. The decor of the place is really nice and it's pretty spacious. I definitely recommend this place if you want to try something new and different!", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "Visited while staying in Atlanta. Maybe \u00a0my boyfriend and I had high expectations because I knew the chef was \u00a0a 2018 James Beard semifinalist, but the food was just ok. \u00a0Just so ok, I wasn't willing to take leftovers (this almost never happens, if it's good I'll even take my other friends leftover to go!). We ate \u00a0till we were full but not stuffed. \u00a0We left feeling unsatisfied and said that once we we were back home in Tampa bay I would make \u00a0a trip immediately to eat at our favorite Indian mom n pop restaurant to now quell my craving for good Indian food. Our favorite thing we had and most unique was the matchsticks okra \u00a0fries (9 dollars) . Huge portion, \u00a0and every single one \u00a0crisp but not too crunchy. We loved these, but the more and more \u00a0we \u00a0ate \u00a0we felt like it was too salty to finish. I would recommend you try these \u00a0because where else would you get a chance to try okra fries?! If you don't like okra, because of the \u00a0taste and sliminess, I'm sure this would convert you instantly! Best way I've ever tried okra. For drinks I tried the safron margarita(10 dollars). \u00a0I love margaritas so I always am up to try a new \u00a0concoction \u00a0of a flavor. I know saffron \u00a0as a spice \u00a0alone has a very strong flavor to begin with and i didn't like it in the margarita. Better suited for food I'd say. I switched to non- alcoholic drink the Lime Rickey \u00a0(four dollars). I really liked this- refreshingly \u00a0delicious and not too sugary. It had raspberry syrup, lime, soda water. \u00a0Good base for a cocktail I thought. Tried the tomatoe and cheese uttapam (13 dollars). A uttapam is a thick savory pancake/ crepe made with rice and lentil batter with toppings cooked right inside the batter. This one had diced tomatoes, cheese, onion, cilantro, curry leaf, ginger, and chilies. Served with sambar and coconut chutney. This was my first time trying this and I just thought it tasted flavorless. Needed a lot of salt and although it had a lot of different spices it was so bland.

It was like the chicken was cooked then dropped in \u00a0precooked sauce and served \u00a0shortly after. Not horrible but not \u00a0good.

Served with sambar & coconut chutney. The biggest reason I would say it's not worth the price is that there are other dishes on the menu that are cheaper than the uttapam, and either has way more food or even just protein, in general. I don't know if it's because it's a specialty item on the menu or what? Next time, I will get the grilled paneer salad, like I originally had planned. Or the samosa, which I got to try today!Otherwise, this place was really good. And they were able to seat all 7 of us without any issues. Thank you for putting up with our table, considering we were all standing around taking photos of the food and met there for a cookie exchange.

I didn't have any of that so I can't speak for it, but the people at my table said it was solid. _ KALE PAKORAS $8.99 (vegetarian) *gf - THIS IS SO GOOD. You would not assume it's kale when it first comes out. It was really cool looking and definitely a crowd pleaser.

Ironic since Chai Pani is located in a renovated garage. Started off with chai tea lattes and mango lassis. The warm chai tea was perfect for a chilly October evening. The mango lassis were refreshing with yogurt and a hint of cardamon. For dinner, our favorites included the samosa chaat and the vegetarian Thali. The potato samosas served on a spicy garbanzo stew was so good. Loved the tamarind and green chutneys that dressed the dish. Thalis are such a great way to sample a variety of dishes. The vegetarian Thali featured kadhai paneer. Loved the traditional cheese in a creamy tomato curry with house roasted masala. Served with fragrant basmati rice, dal, roti, raita, kachumber, papadum, sambar and sooji halwa, it is easily enough for 2. \u00a0My daughter had the vada pav, potato dumplings, served on griddled buns (pav) which she enjoyed as well.

It features Indian street food in a sort of tapas-style (smaller dishes) and it is a sit down restaurant. They have extremely creative dishes here and the food is good. However, they are not going to have those typical Indian dishes you find in Indian restaurants in America, so if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the place for you! Things I like: The food was definitely creative and good here. These are dishes you can't get anywhere else in Atlanta (or many other cities in America for that matter). When I went we ordered the SPDP (Sev Potato Dahi Puri), the Samosa Chaat, and the Chicken Kathi Roll. The service was good and this meal was certainly memorable and I'm very glad I tried it. Things I didn't like: The food was definitely good, but I wasn't blown away by anything we got even though I was really excited to try Chai Pani. The portions were pretty small and I'm sure some of our non-enthusiasm with the food came with out ignorance in not understanding the culture of the dishes. For example, the SPDP was cold, which is how it is meant to be prepared, but just didn't fit my tastes. I also wish the atmosphere was a little better inside the restaurant. Also, keep in mind, Chai Pani shares a parking lot with Farm Burger and it can be really tough to find a parking spot.Overall, Chai Pani is a great place to try and makes for a memorable night out.

Our server appeared to ignore us. Food tickets were lost and no apologies were made when this happened. Both experiences occurred on weeknights when the restaurant doesn't swell to capacity as it does on more popular evenings.

You may have to drive around the perimeter a few times to wait on a spot or possibly do on-street parking farther out and walk over.Atmosphere: the space is a converted garage, so it has an industrial chic mixing metal and wood with vibrant colors and playful decor like old Bollywood film posters. It is a generally lively space since it is almost always busy. You enter into a long foyer where you can check in for a table, order take out, and even grab a sample of puris (puffed crisps) while you wait. Space is fairly large so could accommodate a range of sized groups.Food & Drink: the food is always fantastic and the main reason I come, but the drink options and cocktails aren't bad either! Chai Pani has a full bar and keeps a decent, albeit small, list of solid craft beers on tap. You can certainly enjoy eating here solo, but I'm a fan of bringing a small group and then sharing a number of dishes and the chaats (Indian street food served as small plates).

If sharing isn't really your thing, the thalis (platters) are also pretty good and very filling for one person. On my most recent visit, we ordered the:+ Mango Lassi ($4.50) - yogurt drink; really good, had additional spices that I don't usually taste in other mango lassi + Kale Pakoras ($9) - I'm a big fan of these, like more robust kale chips, but some in my group were instead bigger fans of the...+ Matchstick Okra Fries ($8) - kind of reminds me of shoestring french fries, a great shareable snack, everyone enjoyed them+ Samosa Chaat ($11) - really can't go wrong with an order of samosas+ Sev Potato Dahi Puri (SPDP, $8) - these were recommended by the waitress and were really fabulous, great layers of flavor+ Green Mango Chaat ($10) - another table favorite because its flavors were so fresh and a nice contrast to the fried items+ Sloppy Jai (Kheema Pav, $11) - good but was surprisingly not a favorite + Non-Vegetarian Thali (varies) - unlike the other dishes, this is a full meal by itself, but we shared it amongst the group; it's served with basmati rice, daal, sabji, raita, roti, kachumber, papadum, and dessert + Sooji Halwa ($4) - dessert made of a semolina flour pudding, golden raisins, cashews, cardamom, and pistachios Overall, another solid experience at Chai Pani \u00a0Food, service, and atmosphere was great. Would definitely recommend!", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "Over the last week, I have given out a fair number of 5 star reviews. It's challenging sometimes because for some restaurants they fit perfectly between a 4 and 5 star. How do you approach that? Round up or down?We were invited out to dinner by friends who frequent Chai Pani so we had to give it a try. This was our first Indian food experience in Atlanta. Interestingly, this is also the first place where I have had the chance to try \"street food.\" Most other restaurants you have your usual curries and such but coming to Chai Pani is something quite different. The menu is shorter than most other Indian restaurants (the first good sign that the food is made fresh!). Many of the food on the menu I was not familiar with but luckily they came with a description. This is the second location of this restaurant (the first being in North Carolina). For an appetizer (or Chaat) we had the matchstick okra fries and the chilli chicken. The okra fries were awesome cut very thinly then fried. They were crunchy and still maintained the okra flavor. Cooking with okra can be challenging because if done wrong, they get slimy. The chilli chicken was delicious with savory pieces of chicken nuggets that were fried and then served on a side of ginger chilli sauce. How do they keep the chicken so moist? The world may never know...For entrees, we went with the uttapam which are sort of like a savory crepe or a savory pancake with vegetables baked into it. You can get a mixed vegetable that is vegan or a tomato and cheese one that is vegetarian. We went ahead and got a mixed vegetable uttapam which came with two dinner plate sized crepes that is enough to share. Delicious! Really surprised by how savory this dish was. We also went with a curry special: the butter chicken. It was sweeter than other butter chickens I have had before but also a really delicious dish. I was a little disappointed by the service we got yesterday because it took a while for us to get our order in and then it took a while for us to get the bill... and then to pay. Yes they were busy but surprising though that this was a challenge for them. Other than the waiting, this was a fantastic 5 star experience. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that this was a one time occurrence as I'm eager to come back and give it another go!", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "The food is great but the price is ridiculous.

I had the sloppy Jai and tried my brother's chicken burger. They were seasoned properly, but didn't seem healthy.One complaint- the food was oily as heck. You'd think that by paying more for what is essentially \"street food\", that you'd be getting better quality. I wouldn't come here on a diet, for sure.Coming here is worth a shot.

Honestly, the ambiance is nice (different than traditional restaurant) but food, not impressed at all. I ordered Veg Thali (paneer do pyaz was main item) and the paneer was bland without flavor. Paneer has no taste and the sauce was tangy and it's like both are cooked separately and mixed just before bringing to table. Rice was too much and had some odd smell. Overall thali was a huge disappointment. I ate much better paneer do pyaz else where. On flip side, nimbu pani was good and had good flavor.

I don't know about you, but I kind of get tired of eating burgers and sandwiches all the time.Chai Pani is one of those places where nearly the entire menu is innovative and makes you wanna try a little bit of everything - which you kinda can! The Chaat portion of the menu is composed of \u00a0a variety of shareable finger food dishes, similar to Spanish tapas, except the portions are WAY more generous. I made the mistake of getting both the Kale and Chicken Pakoras by myself (by the way, you can get half-orders as well, which is not mentioned on the menu) and this shit was enough to feed a family. The kale was battered and deep fried, and went perfectly with the yogurt sauce. The chicken was all white meat and I liked it better with the green chutney. Both dishes are probably enough to feed 3 or 4. I also had an order of the SPDP (I'm too un-Indian to remember the full name) which was a refreshing, unique appetizer as well.On top of that, they have a full bar with a bunch of Indian themed cocktails, which looked pretty cool. And they're probably the only spot in this neighborhood serving a good cup of chai ($2.99, including unlimited refills), which is perfect for these winter days. The only gripe I have - I would prefer more spice in the food. I don't want the food toned down for my Americanized, burger-eatin' palate. But that's just personal preference.", "stars": 5.0}, {"review": "One of our favorite Indian restaurants in the country.

It's the best when we walk in and they are serving up some panipuri to eat up before grabbing a table.

You put the entire thing in your mouth and savor.In terms of main dishes, you can't really go wrong but some favorites of mine are the chilli chicken, vada pav, sloppy jai, and chicken kathi roll.

The bhel puri didn't have any of its regular vegetables, potatoes etc. it was just puri bhel mix and chutneys.

I am writing this to draw awareness to my experience so something can be done.", "stars": 3.0}, {"review": "Chai Pani is an Indian restaurant that opened March 2013 in downtown Decatur. This is the restaurant's second location. The original opened in 2009 in Asheville, NC. Both locations are popular. Chai Pani serves chaat (Indian street food), uttapam (crepes), Indian-inspired salads, sandwiches, and burgers, and thalis (traditional meals). The business has a fresh, modern take on Indian cuisine yet is still authentic.Chai Pani shares a building with next door neighbor Farm Burger. Free parking is located on-site, though it may be limited at peak times.Chai Pani is not your typical Indian restaurant. There are Americanized and contemporary twists to both the restaurant design/atmosphere as well as the menu. This place has an open loft/warehouse look. I believe the building originally served as a garage or gas station long ago. The interior is spacious with two dining rooms and a 10-seat bar in the back. During the daytime, natural light fills the space. There's a small covered patio in front. The ambiance is laid back and casual. At lunchtime, you order at the counter and grab water/utensils yourself. At dinnertime, there's sit-down service.Interesting and unique foods include Kale Pakoras (fritters), Matchstick Okra Fries, the Maharaja Lamb Burger, and the Bengali Fish Fry Sandwich, the latter two cooked/prepared with various Indian spices and chutneys. Chai Pani's ingredients are higher quality than most Indian restaurants. They use local dairy products and all-natural, free-range chicken. Spices are ground in-house and chutneys and sauces are made from scratch. Expect to spend about $6-9 each for most chaat and closer to $10 each for salads, sandwiches/burgers, uttapam, and thalis.I've tried several items. Here's a rundown:Chaat (street food):* Kale Pakoras - kale fritters made with curried chickpea batter, served with green chutney and sweet yogurt* Matchstick Okra Fries - julienned okra, battered and fried, tossed with lime, salt, and other seasonings* Panipuri - street snack made with hollowed-out bread (puri) and flavored sauce (pani) (more details below)Sandwiches:* \"Sloppy Jai\" (Kheema Pav) - spiced lamb hash simmered with tomatoes, ginger, and spices, served with onions, cilantro, green chutney, and sweet yogurt* Vada Pav - spicy potato dumplings fried in curried chickpea batter topped with green and tamarind chutneys* Mixed Vegetable Uttapam - crepe made from rice and lentil batter with carrots, peas, onion, cilantro, ginger, and chilies, served with sambar and coconut chutneys* Non-Vegetarian Thali - basmati rice, dal (lentils), kachumber (side salad), roti (soft bread), raita (yogurt), papadum (crispy flatbread), Malabar chicken (more details below)* Mango Lassi - sweet yogurt drink made with mango pulp and cardamomThere's a lot of good food here. My favorites are the Kale Pakoras, Panipuri, Sloppy Jai, and Mixed Veggie Uttapam. Both the Kale Pakoras and Okra Fries are deep-fried and crispy. The batter on both dishes is surprisingly thin and pleasantly light. The sweet yogurt on the Kale Pakoras is a nice touch. Fried kale can often be too greasy or over-battered, but I think Chai Pani has done a nice job with their pakoras. The Okra Fries are almost like chips. The julienning process creates a neat-looking, cross-section-like presentation.Panipuri is a special. I want to say it's the Indian counterpart to Chinese xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), but maybe not quite. Panipuris are hollowed-out fried breads (puri) filled with a potato, chickpea, and spice mixture, mung beans, tamarind chutney, and a cilantro-flavored water/sauce (pani). Each panipuri is bite-size and delicious. Here's a video I recorded of panipuri being prepared at the bar: instagram.com/p/nrC0LjwB\u2026.The Sloppy Jai is mighty tasty and just as satisfying and comforting as some of the best sloppy joes I've had. While the lamb hash has a surprisingly similar consistency to ground beef, it expectedly has a different (good) taste and aroma. While not bad, I'm not as big of a fan of the Vada Pav, though potato sandwiches aren't my thing. Just too much bread and dense starch for me. Both the Sloppy Jai and Vada Pav come on soft, toasted buns.The Mixed Veggie Uttapam is savory. I would characterize its texture more to that of fried hashbrowns than I would a delicate crepe or pancake. Small portion size, but quite fulfilling.The thali is okay and on par, at best, with other Atlanta area Indian restaurants. There aren't many selections to choose from when it comes to Chai Pani's thali, but their focus is street food. The Malabar chicken curry is made with chicken breast, tomatoes, chilies, onion, tumeric, coriander, and coconut milk. Against popular opinion, I think the chicken is too dry and the sauce is mostly unmemorable. My advice: Stick with the snacks, sandwiches, and crepes.Order a mango lassi. It's excellent. Addictive and not too sweet nor thick.Service is great.", "stars": 4.0}, {"review": "Friends raved about this restaurant and it was clear to see why.
